This Claude skill implements proven consulting methodologies for market research, structured as a four-level pyramid analysis:

```
                   YOUR COMPANY (Level 1)
                 Strategic Fit & Positioning
                            ▲
             COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (Level 2)
           Positioning & Differentiation Analysis
                            ▲
          CUSTOMER INSIGHTS (Level 3)
       Needs, Motivations, Barriers, Behaviors
                            ▲
     MARKET & SEGMENT ANALYSIS (Level 4)
    Size, Growth, Trends, Development Opportunities
```

## Features

✅ **Hypothesis-driven methodology** - MECE principle, Issue Trees, 7-step consulting process
✅ **Four-level pyramid analysis** - Systematic bottom-up market research
✅ **CRAAP source validation** - Professional-grade source quality assessment
✅ **Multi-source triangulation** - Validate critical findings with 2-3 independent sources
✅ **Free sources optimization** - Designed for government, academic, and free industry data
✅ **PPTX generation** - Professional presentations via the native `pptx` skill
✅ **Parallel collection** - Three subagents research the Market, Customer, and Competitive levels concurrently

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone or copy this skill to your Claude skills directory
cp -r market-research ~/.claude/skills/

# OR for project-specific installation
cp -r market-research .claude/skills/
```

### 2. Initialize New Research Project

```bash
cd .claude/skills/market-research
bash scripts/init-research.sh "acme-corp" "healthcare"
```

This creates:
- Project structure with templates
- Pre-populated research brief
- Pyramid analysis framework
- Source bibliography tracker

### 3. Execute Three-Phase Workflow

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- Complete `research-brief.md`
- Define hypothesis tree using MECE
- Identify source strategy

**Phase 2: Parallel Collection**
- Dispatch three subagents concurrently: Level 4 (Market & segment), Level 3 (Customer insights), Level 2 (Competitive landscape) — each writes `analysis/level-N-*.md`
- Level 1 (Company positioning) is done after Level 2 returns
- Verify: four verifier subagents independently re-check every Key Finding (Confirmed / Refuted / Unverifiable) → `analysis/verification-report.md`; refuted findings are dropped, unverifiable ones flagged
- Synthesize into `pyramid-analysis.md`

**Phase 3: Synthesis & Deck**
- Update `slide-deck.html` with findings
- Verify the HTML quality checklist (16:9 dims, text in semantic tags, no AI-slop palette)
- Invoke the `pptx` skill with `deliverables/slide-deck.html` for final conversion

## Methodology Details

### MBB 7-Step Process

1. **Define Problem** - SMART criteria, success metrics
2. **Structure Problem** - MECE decomposition, hypothesis trees
3. **Prioritize** - Impact vs. ease, 80/20 rule
4. **Work Plan** - Timeline, sources, responsibilities
5. **Execute Analysis** - Systematic testing, triangulation
6. **Synthesize Findings** - Pyramid Principle, "Day 1 drafts"
7. **Develop Recommendations** - Actionable with ownership

### Source Quality Hierarchy

**Tier 1 (Highest Credibility):**
- Government agencies (Census, BLS, Eurostat)
- Peer-reviewed academic journals
- Public company SEC filings
- Established market research firms

**Tier 2 (High Credibility):**
- Industry associations
- Premium databases (IBISWorld, Euromonitor)
- Think tanks and research centers
- Consulting firm public research

**Tier 3 (Requires Verification):**
- Company white papers
- Industry blogs and media
- Third-party databases
- Must be cross-validated with Tier 1-2

### CRAAP Test Framework

Every source evaluated on 5 dimensions (1-5 scale):

- **Currency** - Publication date and timeliness
- **Relevance** - Fit to research question
- **Authority** - Author credentials and reputation
- **Accuracy** - Methodology and verification
- **Purpose** - Intent and potential bias

**Quality thresholds:**
- 22-25: Excellent (use as primary)
- 18-21: Good (use confidently)
- 14-17: Acceptable (use with caution)
- <14: Questionable or reject

## Dependencies

### Required

- **Claude Code** - This skill runs within Claude environment
- **Bash** - For init-research.sh script (Unix/Linux/Mac)
- **Python 3.6+** - For validate-sources.py script

### PPTX generation

- **`pptx` skill** (Anthropic document-skills suite) - invoked directly in Claude Code for HTML→PPTX conversion. No local installation or git submodule required.

## Usage Examples

4. Security/compliance (65%)

Deliverable: Customer insights deck with decision journey map
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Hypothesis

❌ **Wrong:** "Let me collect all available data on healthcare market"
✅ **Right:** "Hypothesis: Telehealth market will grow 15%+ due to aging population and tech adoption"

### 2. Apply MECE Ruthlessly

❌ **Wrong:** Overlapping segments (SMB, Mid-market, Enterprise, B2B)
✅ **Right:** Mutually exclusive (B2B SMB, B2B Enterprise, B2C)

### 3. Triangulate Critical Findings

❌ **Wrong:** Single source for market size: "$4B market"
✅ **Right:** Three sources converge: $4.0B, $4.2B, $4.1B → High confidence: $4.1B

### 4. Document Everything

❌ **Wrong:** "Market growing fast" (no source)
✅ **Right:** "Market growing 12% CAGR (Source: IBISWorld 2024, CRAAP: 23/25)"

### 5. Continuous Synthesis

❌ **Wrong:** Collect all data first, then analyze at end
✅ **Right:** "Day 1 draft" immediately, refine continuously

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Accepting Sources at Face Value
**Solution:** CRAAP test every source, score ≥18 for primary evidence

### Pitfall 2: Cherry-picking Data
**Solution:** Document comprehensive search, explain exclusions

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Original Context
**Solution:** Understand data collection purpose and methodology

### Pitfall 4: Outdated Information
**Solution:** Check publication dates, apply growth rates to update

### Pitfall 5: Unclear Methodology
**Solution:** Reject sources without transparent methodology

## Integration with document-skills/pptx

### HTML → PPTX Requirements

The slide-deck.html template follows html2pptx format:

✅ **Correct dimensions:** 720pt × 405pt (16:9)
✅ **Semantic HTML:** All text in `<p>`, `<h1>-<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`
✅ **Professional colors:** No purple gradients (#6366F1, #8B5CF6)
✅ **Proper structure:** No text directly in `<div>` or `<span>`

### PPTX Generation Workflow

1. Complete pyramid-analysis.md with findings
2. Update slide-deck.html with data from analysis
3. Verify the HTML quality checklist (16:9 dimensions, all text in semantic tags, no AI-slop purple palette, every data point cited)
4. Invoke the `pptx` skill with the HTML file
5. Review generated PPTX for quality

## Quality Checklist

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Scripts don't run
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
chmod +x scripts/*.py

# Ensure dependency installed
python3 --version  # Should be 3.6+
```

### Issue: PPTX generation fails
**Solution:**
- Verify HTML has correct dimensions (720pt × 405pt)
- Check all text is in semantic tags (`<p>`, `<h1>`, etc.)
- Ensure the native `pptx` skill is available in your Claude environment
- Follow the `pptx` skill's html2pptx guidance for colors and layout

### Issue: Sources score low on CRAAP
**Solution:**
- Prioritize Tier 1 sources (government, academic)
- Verify publication dates within 3 years
- Check methodology transparency
- Cross-validate with additional sources

### Issue: Can't find data for market sizing
**Solution:**
- Try bottom-up estimation (components → total)
- Use proxy markets and apply ratios
- Leverage Census data and industry associations
- See FREE_SOURCES_GUIDE.md for discovery strategies
